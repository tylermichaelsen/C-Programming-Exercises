# Personal Solutions for "Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (3rd Edition)"

This is my personal repository where I post my solutions and notes for the exercises in *Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (3rd Edition)* by Bjarne Stroustrup. This repository is mainly for my own personal use.

I figured I'd make this repo public as sometimes its hard to get the program working due to the unsupported header files and modules.
